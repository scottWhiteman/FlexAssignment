        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!--Programming-->
        <p>When I used to play plenty of video games and use computer applications back then, I wanted to learn more about making them.  I found that I enjoyed programming and analyzing why programs act the way they do.</p>

        <!--Design and Web Development-->
        <p>I also like understanding designs, what looks appealing to the eye and what helps people see ergonomically.  While I am also interested in learning to illustrate and animate, I find that Web Development lets me bridge both coding and design together and enjoy the process.</p>

        <!-- Outside Interstes-->
        <p>As I continue learning as a Web Developer, I am still interested in learning to animate and once in a while I play video games.</p>

        <!--Working with a team-->
        <p>Even though I tend to spend more time to myself and my investments, I also have fun working with other people and teams: it's always more lively with other people, so don't be afraid to ping me with a message if you need a developer!</p>
